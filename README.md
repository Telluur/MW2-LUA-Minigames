# MW2-LUA-Minigames
- Place the lua folder and lua53.dll in your MW2 folder.
- Inject MW2Lua.dll into Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (iw4mp.exe) while in the game menu.
- Head into a private lobby (for most games FFA is recommended, disable the score limits)
- Commands can be found in game.lua

N.b. The binary dll blobs remain closed source, to prevent abuse in public lobbies. Please do not contact me about this.
